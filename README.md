# thinsection

Old project trying to classify lithologies on microscope thin sections of pre-salt carbonates.

Idea would be to fine tune this classification model and then use weights to detect higher impact areas to attempt an image segmentation model.

The paper (not my be) linked here details the metodology we intended to use.
